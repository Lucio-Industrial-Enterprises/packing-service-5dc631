# Warehouse tools

Small Python utilities for warehouse order and shipping workflows.

Run the tests with `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`.

## Shipping

`shipping_quote(weight_kg, zone, service="standard")` returns a delivery quote
in dollars. Zones are `"local"` and `"regional"`; weights must be positive.
Service levels are `"standard"` (default) and `"express"` (adds $7.00).

```python
from warehouse.rates import shipping_quote

shipping_quote(2, "local")                      # → 8.0  (standard)
shipping_quote(2, "local", service="express")   # → 15.0 (express)
```

The command-line entry point prints a quote for an order:

```
python -m warehouse.cli 2 local
python -m warehouse.cli 2 local --service express
```
